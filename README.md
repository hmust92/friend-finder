# Friend Finder

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- it will find you a friend! This full-stack site will take in results from a users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match, based on their own answers!

The live link is shown at the top of the page.

To run it locally, open your terminal simply clone it to your computer.

After that, go into the directory, open your terminal and and write ```npm install```

Once that is complete, in the terminal write ```node server.js```

Open your browser and write ```http://localhost:8080```, and the application will start. 

Enjoy!
